# README for ContactFox 
Contacts on the mobile device are sometimes a complete mess. They have to be exported and re-imported from one device to another, they are sometimes kept and used in different places. I migrated from a Siemens Phone to the first Palm Pre to a Samsung Bada device and finally to a Geeksphone Keon with Firefox OS. And I didn't like to share this sensitive personal data with Google and the NSA, so any cloud solution wasn't an option for me. As a result there are quite a number of redundant entries in my contacts, some mixing up first and last-name and some have funny characters like Backslashes and Double-quotes from an CSV import going bad. 

ContactFox is a packaged app for FirefoxOS. It's intended purpose is to help organize the contacts on the phone. I know, duplicate contacts can also be merged with the newer version of the native contact application, but my aim is to do it more comfortable and for many duplicates at once and add more functions to clean up the contacts on the phone. 

It is currently still work and progress. It works on my Keon device, but some features are yet unimplemented. Be careful it might delete some of your data. It's an vehicle for me to embrace  study and learn the technologies surrounding HTML5 and Firefox OS. 

If the most severe issues are fixed version 0.5 will be released to the Firefox marketplace.
