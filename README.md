# README for ContactFox 
Contacts on the mobile device are sometimes a complete mess. They have to be exported and reimported from on device to another, they are sometimes kept and used in different places. I migrated from a Siemens Phone to the first Palm Pre to a Samsung Bada device and finaly to a Geeksphone Keon with Firefox OS. And I didn't like to share this sensitive personal data with Google and the NSA, so any cloud solution wasn't an option for me. As a result there are quite a number of redundant entries in my contacts, some mixing up first and lastname and some have funny characters like Backslashes and Doublequotes from an CSV import going bad. 

ContactFox is a packaged app for FirefoxOS. It intended purpose is to help organize the contacts on the phone. I know, dupplicate contacts can also be merged with the newer version of the native contact applicatition, but my aim is to do it more confortable and for many dupplicates at once and add more functions to clean up the contacts on the phone. 

It is currently still work and progress. It works on my Keon device, but some features are yet unimplemented. Be carefull it might delete some of your data. It's an vehicle for me to embrace  study and learn the technologies surrounding HTML5 and firefox OS. 

If the most severe issues are fixed version 0.5 will be released to the firefox marketplace.
